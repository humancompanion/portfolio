        In the Fall of 2014, USAJOBS partnered with The Lab at OPM to use a
        Human-Centered Design (HCD) approach to re-imagine the user experience
        on the website. The integrated design team began to collect meaningful
        data from job seekers, hiring managers, Human Resource (HR) Specialists,
        and agency Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCOs) through a series of
        qualitative interviews, behavioral observations, and analogous empathy
        experiences. I joined the team in October of 2015 soon after this
        research was complete. Coming into a project where I did not have to
        push the product owner to conduct research was a refreshing change.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team conducted <strong>12</strong> focus groups with over
        <strong>130 people across the country</strong> to capture a diverse user
        population. They spoke with over <strong>80 users one on one</strong> to
        discuss their experiences, needs, and pain points with USAJOBS and the
        federal hiring experience. Over 2,400 pieces of data were transcribed
        and visualized in The Lab. Thus coming into the project my small
        3-person UX team had a firehose of information pointed at us as we
        attempted to take the 6 design pillars and 17 recommendations and turn
        those into a cohesive plan of action.
      </p>
      <h3>Formulating a plan</h3>
      <p>
        My colleague,
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/min-chung-b456a567/">Min Chung</a>,
        and I took our oath to the American people on the same day. We joined
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyhryt/">Ky Taylor</a> who was
        already working with the USAJOBS Program Office to revamp the
        application process. Thus we started by helping Ky and the team improve
        the application process as much as possible. In fact, our first day was
        a co-design session with members of the 9 Talent Acquisition Systems
        that USAJOBS connects to in order for users to complete a job
        application. The Lab has since conducted
        <strong>10 similar co-design sessions</strong> with HR Specialists,
        CHCOs, federal employees, Veterans, hiring managers, and members of the
        public. Those sessions typically have a topic that we focus the group on
        and include activities such as card sorts, affinity diagrams, sketching,
        and service blueprinting.
      </p>
      <p>
        After we had shipped the initial revision to the application process I
        decided we need to build from that strength to modernize the rest of the
        site. The development team had just used Twitter's Bootstrap to make the
        site responsive. However, this had been done quickly and without the
        involvement of the design team. Thus there were odd choices in certain
        places. For example, two hamburger menus on the same page. Thus I
        formulated two plans.
      </p>
      <h4>USAJOBS Design System</h4>
      <p>
        The first was to build upon the newly released U.S. Web Design System
        (then known as the Standards). I had just come off of building
        <a href="/case-study/marriott/"
          >several design systems</a
        >
        with
        <a href="https://medium.com/@nathanacurtis"
          >Nathan Curtis at EightShapes</a
        >
        and so I was initmately familiar with what a design system could bring
        in terms of consistency and continuity across the site. In addition, I
        knew it would give us a mechanism to start to build a better
        relationship with the development team and involve them more in thinking
        about the site wholistically.
      </p>
      <h4>American Discovery Trail</h4>
      <p>
        The second plan was a concept: the American Discovery Trail. Named after
        the actual <a href="https://discoverytrail.org/">trail</a> which runs
        6,800 miles from coast to coast, our trail would be an optimized path
        that directs users to relevant jobs. To accomplish this we set out an
        aggressive plan to build and connect a new landing & home page, search,
        and profile in one year.
      </p>
      <p>
        We picked this concept because we wanted to build from the strength of
        the new application guide which had given early indications that it was
        reducing the exit rate of applicants who had decided to apply
        (eventually we learned that the exit rate of 7.3% had dropped to 2.7% as
        of 8/2016). More importantly we had pulled three key expectations from
        the 6 months of research that had been conducted:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Guide me to the right job and then through the process </li>
      </ol>
