    <p class="enlarge">
      I am a human-centered designer with the ability to think and act on the
      surface to the core of a product or service. I focus on problem framing
      and continual discovery, including research and co-design with users, to
      creatively solve problems and make solutions real via rapid prototyping.
    </p>
    <p class="enlarge">
      I have been focused on digital transformation of federal hiring for the
      last three years in my work for The Lab at OPM. I believe a federal
      government infused with human-centered design will one day consistently make
      evidenced-based policy decisions informed by qualitative and quantitative
      research done with citizens. I have fifteen years of experience designing
      and building software to manage critical enterprise processes. I bridge
      the gap from strategist to practitioner and help teams ship.

          Created the "American Discovery Trail" initiative, a strategic and

          of USAJOBS find and apply to jobs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Executed the project plan, leading a team of 2 expert designers in
          designing, prototyping, and delivering 6 key releases in 2016 that
