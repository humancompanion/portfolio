      <p class="enlarge">
        I am a human-centered designer with the ability to think and act on the surface to the core of a product or service. I focus on problem framing and continual discovery, including research with users, to creatively solve problems and make solutions real via rapid HTML, CSS, and Javascript prototyping.</p>
      <p>
        I have worked on several large-scale client design systems (USAJOBS, Cisco, Marriott, Yahoo) and led several responsive design projects. I have over fifteen years of experience designing and building software to manage critical enterprise processes. I bridge the gap from designer to front-end development and help teams ship.
