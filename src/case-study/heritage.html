        My first project for EightShapes gave me a chance to immerse myself in JavaScript and contribute to a remarkable new way to experience the Constitution of the United States.

        EightShapes has already <a href="https://articles.uie.com/power_of_sketches/">told the story of how this project evolved</a>. What it doesn't cover however was the amount of work that went into actually building the design. My experience in creating and managing technical plans at Microsoft &amp; Tellme were critical to the success of the project.

        The design boiled down to a one page application with a few states and transitions between those states. While we could (and perhaps should) have used an existing MVC-based JS framework, all of those I evaluated seemed too heavy for the task at hand. I ended up writing my own lightweight framework to pull and process the JSON data, handle state changes, and provide a fast, seemless experience on all devices.

      One of the challenges of the project that the design did not forsee was ordinal search. The Constitution is filled with numbers (Article 1 or I, Section 2, Amendment 21) and ordinal numbers (1st Article, Twenty-First Amendment). The autosuggest functionality needed to handle both across articles and amendments. Unfortunately for me there was not a JavaScript library to handle this. Thus I ended up porting parts of the <a href="http://deveiate.org/code/linguistics/Linguistics/EN.html#method-i-ordinate">Ruby Linguistics::EN</a> module to JS.
