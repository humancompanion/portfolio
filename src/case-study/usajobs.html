        In the Fall of 2014, USAJOBS partnered with The Lab at OPM to use a
        Human-Centered Design (HCD) approach to re-imagine the user experience
        on the website. The integrated design team began to collect meaningful
        data from job seekers, hiring managers, Human Resource (HR) Specialists,
        and agency Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCOs) through a series of
        qualitative interviews, behavioral observations, and empathy
        experiences. I joined the team in October of 2015 soon after this
        research was complete. Coming into a project where I did not have to
        push the product owner to conduct research was a refreshing change.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team conducted <strong>12</strong> focus groups with over
        <strong>130 people across the country</strong> to capture a diverse user
        population. They spoke with over <strong>80 users one on one</strong> to
        discuss their experiences, needs, and pain points with USAJOBS and the
        federal hiring experience. Over <strong>2,400 pieces of data</strong> were transcribed and visualized in The Lab. Thus coming into the project my small
        3-person UX team had a firehose of information pointed at us as we
        attempted to take the 6 design pillars and 17 recommendations and turn
        those into a cohesive plan of action.

      <h3>Formulating a plan</h3>
      <p>
        My colleague,
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/min-chung-b456a567/">Min Chung</a>,
        and I took our oath to the American people on the same day. We joined
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyhryt/">Ky Taylor</a> who was
        already working with the USAJOBS Program Office to revamp the
        application process. Thus we started by helping Ky and the team improve
        the application process as much as possible. In fact, our first day was
        a co-design session with members of the 9 Talent Acquisition Systems
        that USAJOBS connects to in order for users to complete a job
        application. The Lab has since conducted
        <strong>10 similar co-design sessions</strong> with HR Specialists,
        CHCOs, federal employees, Veterans, hiring managers, and members of the
        public. Those sessions typically have a topic that we focus the group on
        and include activities such as card sorts, affinity diagrams, sketching,
        and service blueprinting.
      </p>
      <p>
        After we had shipped the initial revision to the application process I
        decided we need to build from that strength to modernize the rest of the
        site. The development team had just used Twitter's Bootstrap, a prototyping toolkit, to make the site responsive. However, this had been done quickly and without the involvement of any designers. Thus there were odd choices in certain
        places. For example, two hamburger menus on the same page. Thus I
        formulated two plans.
      </p>
      <h4>USAJOBS Design System</h4>
      <p>
        The first was to build upon the newly released U.S. Web Design System
        (then known as the Standards). I had just come off of building
        <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/case-study/marriott/">several design systems</a>
        with
        <a href="https://medium.com/@nathanacurtis">Nathan Curtis at EightShapes</a>
        and so I was intimately familiar with what a design system could bring
        in terms of consistency and continuity across the site. In addition, I
        knew it would give us a mechanism to start to build a better
        relationship with the development team and involve them more in thinking
        about the site holistically.
      </p>
      <h4>American Discovery Trail</h4>
      <div class="l-case_study__photo-pair-container">
        <p class="l-case_study__photo-pair">
          The second plan was a concept: the American Discovery Trail. Named after
          the actual <a href="https://discoverytrail.org/">trail</a> which runs
          6,800 miles from coast to coast, our trail would be an optimized path
          that directs users to relevant jobs. To accomplish this we set out a
          plan to build and connect a new landing & home page, revitalize search, and redesign the profile in one year. While we understood that working in an agile fashion would likely mean plenty of detours, we wanted to articulate a concept and
          set
          an ambitious roadmap in order to galvanize the team around a specific goal.
        </p>
        <div class="l-case_study__photo-pair is-img">
          <img alt="American Discovery Trail logo" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/case-study/usajobs/adt-logo.png" class="img--1x" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        We picked this concept because we wanted to build from the strength of
        the new application guide which had given early indications that it was
        reducing the exit rate of applicants who had decided to apply
        (eventually we learned that the exit rate of 7.3% had dropped to 2.7% and we had reduced help desk tickets by nearly 25% as
        of 8/2016). More importantly we had pulled three key expectations from
        the aforementioned research with job seekers and applicants:

<div class="l-grid g-row g-ML-guttersLarge">
  <div class="g-cell g-B--full g-ML--1of3">
    <h5>1. Guide me to the right job and then through the process.</h5>
    <ul class="list--bullet">
      <li>USAJOBS falls short of applicant expectations because it presents itself as a one-stop shop for federal hiring, but in reality it is laid on top of a disjointed process spread among 129 agencies, which disorients, frustrates, and
        misleads users.</li>
      <li>Users are overwhelmed by irrelevant and confusing hiring information on USAJOBS, opm. gov, and other systems which reflects the complicated processes applicants must traverse. This leads to doubt and frustrations that causes them to
        either over apply for jobs they aren’t qualified for or abandon the application process all together.</li>
      <li>Applying for a government job is a long and arduous process. It is made even worse because the government doesn’t set user expectations up front about what they need to apply and how long it will take them.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="g-cell g-B--full g-ML--1of3">
    <h5>2. Explain the job clearly.</h5>
    <ul class="list--bullet">
      <li>OPM does not communicate eligibility and qualifications in a meaningful way. Applicants do not understand that there are prerequisites to being considered for a job. They apply to jobs they can’t get resulting in increased applications,
        workload for the government, and frustration for multiple users in the system.</li>
      <li>USAJOBS isn’t giving anyone everything they need so applicants, agencies, and the USAJOBS Program rely on other websites and people to find jobs, get and give answers and post job information because they are more successful avenues.
        This further exacerbates the already fractured hiring process. While delegated examining makes this difficult, OPM currently owns the responsibility of managing job announcements.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="g-cell g-B--full g-ML--1of3">
    <h5>3. Don't be a black hole.</h5>
    <ul class="list--bullet">
      <li>Notifications from USAJOBS and letters from agencies are not in plain language. This results in confused applicants calling HR offices. HR Specialists become frustrated and avoid communications with unselected candidates.</li>
      <li>Applicants do not receive notifications in a timely manner. By the time an applicant receives notification they may no longer find it useful or applicable to their job search. This diminishes trust and reliability of the system.</li>
      <li>The Talent Acquisition Systems and USAJOBS operate almost entirely independently and issue multiple, separate notifications at different points in the process, if at all. This is confusing to applicants.</li>
      <li>HR Specialists need the hiring manager to decide who is moving on before notifications can be sent which causes delays.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="l-grid g-row g-ML-guttersLarge g-XL-guttersRemoveOuter">
  <div class="g-cell g-B--full g-ML--fit">
    <p>We had a few high level goals for the trail:</p>
    <ul class="list--bullet">
      <li>Start to change the perception of the hiring process to increase engagement.</li>
      <li>Improve confidence in the federal hiring process by guiding users to relevant jobs.</li>
      <li>Reduce the number of ineligible applicants to lower the workload of HR and improve the system.</li>
      <li>Identify policies that complicate the hiring process and practices for future improvements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In addition to these goals we had specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for reach release that would allow us to measure our progress as we made changes.
    </p>
    <h3>Prototype, test, build, ship</h3>
    <p>
      The new application guide shipped in February 2016 and from there we went about building the trail. The next release adopted our new <a href="https://usajobs.github.io/design-system/" target="_blank">Design System</a> which in turn has us
      adopt the base elements of the <a href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Web Design System</a>. We didn't convert the entire site at once to every element and component in the system. But we did pick up the colors,
      typography, and grid in this first release and then inventoried and prioritized the components we would adopt next. Navigation was the top component and so that was done first.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to speed up our output I also decided around this time to convince the development team to let the design team own the help site. At the time the site was a MediaWiki that was in need of desperate pruning. We conducted a number of
      card sort activities with users and took an inventory of the content. I also paid close attention to <a href="https://developmentseed.org/projects/healthcare-gov/" target="_blank">lessons learned from healthcare.gov</a> and decided to build
      the Help Center site with simple, open tools, like github and jekyll, that would generate a static site that would not buckle under <a href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" target="_blank">our traffic</a>, regardless of where it was deployed.
      This is a pattern I've since used a number of times, deploying those sites to GitHub pages, and now to cloud.gov via 18F's <a href="https://federalist.18f.gov/">Federalist</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I combined that pattern of building small, static sites, with what I had learned at <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/resume/#eightshapes">EightShapes</a>: Get to full fidelity prototypes as quickly as possible. By creating prototypes and
      usability testing them with users we were able to learn and iterate ahead of handing the design off to development. While not the ideal agile practice of having designers and developers working together on the same thing, it did allow us to
      raise the quality of what we were delivering.

    <p>
      Moving into 2017 we replaced our search engine with Elasticsearch and focused on the relevance and precision of our search results. We also revamped the job announcement and created a <a href="https://usajobs.github.io/ATP-Support/job-announcement-playbook/"
        target="_blank">job announcement playbook</a>. In 2018 I played a role in pushing for integration with <a href="https://login.gov/" target="_blank">login.gov</a>. After that I was asked to spend 3 months on leading a project that
      <a href="https://www.performance.gov/CAP/action_plans/FY2018_Q1_People_Workforce_for_the_21st_Century.pdf">demonstrates the initial capability of an automated hiring advisor for managers</a>, a key milestone of
      <a href="https://www.performance.gov/CAP/CAP_goal_3.html">CAP goal 3 (Developing a Workforce for the 21st Century)</a>
      of the President’s Management Agenda. Once I returned from that project we focused on further improvements to the user profile of the Core product as well as enhancements to the <a href="https://openopps.usajobs.gov/" target="_blank">Open
        Opportunities</a> site that we inherited from GSA's 18F.
