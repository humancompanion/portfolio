        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <h3 id="ux">UX Design</h3>
        <p class="enlarge">
          I worked with the folks who wrote the books on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Together-collaboration-management-professionals/dp/0321918630/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1437413699&sr=1-1&keywords=designing+together&pebp=1437413700631&perid=05S5CGEBV4NHD32XEE58">designing together</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Modular-Web-Design-Components-Documentation/dp/0321601351/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1437413752&sr=1-1&keywords=nathan+curtis&pebp=1437413753638&perid=1FRS8WA1G7FSYACQYNDV">building smaller components into larger systems</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Communicating-Design-Developing-Documentation-Planning/dp/0321712463/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1437413724&sr=1-1&pebp=1437413725648&perid=0SNZ73VF84013EY35DA0">communicating those designs</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
         So at this point I'm pretty good at those things. Combined with what I had learned over ten years in Silicon Valley, I'm now well equipped to tackle any design problem. While the <a href="case-study/">case studies</a> cover some of what I've had the opportunity to do there were plenty of other projects that allowed me to grow in the following ways:
        </p>
        <h4>Design Research</h4>
        <p>
          I've conducted dozens of stakeholder and user interviews including both qualitative and quantitative research to inform and validate designs. I'm comfortable creating test plans, scheduling participants, conducting sessions, and reporting the results.
        </p>

        <h4>Information Architecture</h4>
        <p>
          I've done content inventories and analysis for the purposes of normalization and driving teams towards standards as well as understanding the nuances of a problem space. One benefit of being able to read code is that I can review existing sites for conformity to accessibility requirements or determine how many layout variations are in use.
        </p>

        <h4>Communication</h4>
        <p>
          I've been working remotely for nearly ten years. I know how to present designs remotely, how to make myself available to teammates and clients, and how to stay in the loop on a project. I've got a door I can shut and a structure to my everyday that works for me and my family.
        </p>

        <h4>Complex problems</h4>
        <p>
          I've helped clients like Yahoo and Microsoft solve complicated and nuanced problems that required quick and deep analysis to gain a breadth and depth of understanding. I'm not afraid of complexity. I worked on visualizing and managing one of the largest VoIP networks in the world (before <em>cloud</em> was a buzzword).
        </p>
        <p>
          I have lead sketching studios with clients in order to generate ideas and then continued to involve stakeholders in order to iterate on the best ideas.
        </p>

        <h3 id="dev">Development</h3>
        <p>
          Being able to make things happen on a screen is a critical skill. I've been at it for a long time and thus I'm familiar with the "full stack" required to produce a product or service on the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of my code contributions as of late were made to the <a href="https://github.com/EightShapes/Blocks">EightShapes Blocks prototyping framework</a>. Specifically, I moved Blocks to ES6 using jspm and SystemJS. This sets Blocks up for future modular expansion.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been on all sides of coding projects: Manager, designer, back-end engineer, front-end developer, QA, and Dev Ops. Most recently I've done a fair amount of front-end development and that's where I'm most comfortable.
        </p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I stumbled into Silicon Valley at an ideal time for me (1996) and worked my way from customer service at WebTV through a bunch of positions eventually ending in Senior Software Engineer for Microsoft. I made more friends than enemies and enjoyed that time immensely. I still miss California even though I've been back in DC since 2006. The weather, friends, food, running trails. I still <a href="http://runkeeper.com/user/humancompanion/profile">run</a> and race as much as I can.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm married and a father to an awesome 5 year-old girl. My wife, daughter, and I go on lots of nature walks, <a href="https://vine.co/v/eAULIlV66he">build stuff</a>, watch &amp; read <a href="http://www.octonauts.com/">Octonauts</a>, break stuff, splish, and splash together.
        </p>
        <p>
          They indulge me and let me watch lots of soccer. I am an ardent supporter of the US Men's and Women's National teams, <a href="http://www.chelseafc.com/">Chelsea FC</a> (pre-Abramovich), and a <a href="http://www.dcunited.com">DC United</a> season ticket holder since '06. If you start a conversation with me about f√∫tbol expect me to not shut up about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I played in a band for many years on <a href="http://www.slumberlandrecords.com/artists/show/12">Slumberland Records</a>. I'm scheming rather than playing at the moment but hope to return to the studio soon.
        </p>
