        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p class="enlarge">
          My former employers at EightShapes wrote the books on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Together-collaboration-management-professionals/dp/0321918630/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1437413699&sr=1-1&keywords=designing+together&pebp=1437413700631&perid=05S5CGEBV4NHD32XEE58">designing together</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Modular-Web-Design-Components-Documentation/dp/0321601351/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1437413752&sr=1-1&keywords=nathan+curtis&pebp=1437413753638&perid=1FRS8WA1G7FSYACQYNDV">building and organizing large systems</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Communicating-Design-Developing-Documentation-Planning/dp/0321712463/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1437413724&sr=1-1&pebp=1437413725648&perid=0SNZ73VF84013EY35DA0">communicating those designs</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
         So at this point I had better be pretty good at those things. Luckily, I learned a ton from them. While the case studies cover some of what I've had the opportunity to do there were plenty of other projects that allowed me to grow in the following ways:
        </p>
        <h3>Design Research</h3>
        <p>
          I've conducted dozens of stakeholder and user interviews including both qualatative and quantative research to inform and validate designs. I'm comfortable creating test plans, scheduling participants, conducting tests of the design, and reporting the results.
        </p>

        <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
        <p>
          I've done content inventories and analysis for the purposes of normalization and driving teams towards standards as well as understanding the nuances of a problem space. One benefit of being able to read code is that I can review existing sites for conformity to accessibility requirements or determine how many layout variations are in use.
        </p>

        <h3>Communication</h3>
        <p>
          I've been working remotely for nearly ten years. I know how to present designs remotely, how to make myself available to teammates and clients, and how to stay in the loop on a project. I've got a door I can shut and a structure to my everyday that works for me and my family.
        </p>

        <h3>Complex problems</h3>
        <p>
          I've helped clients like Yahoo and 3M solve complicated and nuanced problems that required quick and deep analysis to gain a breadth and depth of understanding. I'm not afraid of complexity. I worked on one of the largest VoIP networks in the world before <em>cloud</em> was a buzzword.
        </p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I stumbled into Silicon Valley at the right time, making more friends than enemies. I still miss California even though I've been back in DC since 2006. It is mostly the weather, friends, and the running trails I miss the most. I still <a href="http://runkeeper.com/user/humancompanion/profile">run</a> and race as much as I can.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm married and a father to an awesome 5 year-old girl. My wife, daughter, and I go on lots of nature walks, build stuff, watch Octonauts, break stuff, splish, and splash together. They are priority number 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          They indulge me and let me watch lots of soccer. I am an ardent supporter of the US Men's and Women's National teams, <a href="http://www.chelseafc.com/">Chelsea FC</a> (pre-Abramovich), and a <a href="http://www.dcunited.com">DC United</a> season ticket holder since '06. If you start a conversation with me about f√∫tbol expect me to not shut up about it.
