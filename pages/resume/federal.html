    <h2>Profile</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="section_body first">
    <p class="enlarge">
      I am a human-centered designer with the ability to think and act on the surface to the core of a product or service. I focus on problem framing and continual discovery, including research and co-design with users, to creatively solve problems and make solutions real via rapid prototyping.
    </p>
    <p class="enlarge">
      I have been focused on digital transformation of federal hiring for the
      last five years in my work for U.S. Digital Service and The Lab at OPM. I believe a federal government infused with human-centered design will one day consistently make evidenced-based policy decisions informed by qualitative and quantitative research done with citizens. I have fifteen years of experience designing and building software to manage critical enterprise processes. I bridge the gap from strategist to practitioner and help teams ship.
